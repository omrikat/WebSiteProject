## Getting Started

##Infrastructure
### 1.Install and Run with Docker (recommended)
Docker with docker-compose is the official and recommend way of installing and running Pigallery2. It contains all necessary dependencies, auto restarts on reboot, supports https, easy to upgrade to newer versions. For configuration and docker-compose files read more here or check all builds: https://hub.docker.com/r/bpatrik/pigallery2/tags/
###2.Direct Install 
if you are familiar with Node.js and building npm packages from source)
As an alternative, you can also directly install Node.js and the app and run it natively.

###2.1.1 Install Node.js
####Download and extract
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

```
###2.2.2 Install PiGallery2
Note: A build requires a machine with around 2GB or memory.
```
cd ~
wget https://github.com/bpatrik/pigallery2/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd pigallery2-master # enter the unzipped directory
npm install
npm run build
```
Note: It is recommended to create a release version with npm run create-release on a more powerful machine and deploy that to you server.

Note: you can use npm run create-release -- --languages=fr,ro to restrict building to the listed languages (English is added by default)

###Run PiGallery2
```
npm start
```

### :gear: Configuration

‚òòÔ∏è **Prepared a script that install all the plugins that needs **Instance Jenkins Server**
You can find inside:**

```

üåø **Prepared a script that install all the plugins that needs **Instance SonarQube Server**
You can find inside:**
```
git clone https://github.com/shadibdair/securcodes/blob/main/poc/sonarqube-script.sh
```


<!-- Deployment -->
### :triangular_flag_on_post: Deployment

```
üçÑ This project start deploy once you add new feature inside the code of web-app.
The trigger will notify the job in jenkins, and start scanning the entire project to find vulnerabilities.
Inside the sonarqube I've configure some condition how to scan the code.
```

```
If Quality Gate Status Check returned OK ... 
Continue to the next stage/step in according to jenkinsfile pipeline.
```

```
üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è The next stage/step dockerize the application and push it to dockerhub.
```

```
üê£ The last stage/step I've deploy the application into cluster k8s using minikube as cluster.
In this case I used Ansible Playbook, 
that access to ec2 cluster and create a deployment and nodeport service for external access.
After that pullin the image from dockerhub and added to deployment yaml 
that I've created to use it inside the K8S in this case I used Minikube.
